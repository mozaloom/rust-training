# Rust Template

A good starting point for a new Rust project.

## Usage

1. Create a new Rust project:
   ```bash
   cargo new <project_name>
   ```

2. Navigate to the new project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   ```

3. Move the make file to the new directory.
   ```bash
   mv /path/to/Makefile .
   ```

4. Start building your Rust project!
